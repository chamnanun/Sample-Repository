# FinTech Repository   

#My name is Chuck Un. I have a 20-year career in the financial services industry specialized in private banking and commercial banking loan originations. Previously, I served as a Senior Commercial Relationship Manager at Wells Fargo Bank for the past 10 years. 

#Leverage my prior experiences in credit originations and front office knowledge to be a value add contributer when combined with data analytics and technical program requirements.  

#I chosed FinTech to learn to be more effective in Python, Panda, and SQL.  Hopefully, forecasting credit and other economic data trends.
